	Description:
Planting a Tree
Introduce yourself to users and plant a tree for them!

Tasks:
Creating the Class
1.We’re starting with a blank Java file named Tree.java.

Define a class that follows the Java naming conventions.


2.This code produces an error because our program needs a main() method.

Define this method inside the curly braces of the Tree class.



3.Write a comment in main() that describes the task it will perform.

We’re going to introduce ourselves and print a tree to the screen.

You can use the single-line or multi-line syntax for your comment.


4.Below your comment, print a message introducing yourself to the user.

Try something like “Hey there, I’m Ariel and I’m learning to code in Java!”

When you run the code, you should see this message printed to the screen.


Planting Trees
5.After introducing yourself, use another print statement to output the project goal!

Something like “I’m going to plant a tree today!” or “Ready to get my hands dirty!”

6.See how the second statement begins on a new line? We’ll use multiple print statements to plant our tree.

For example:

    System.out.println("  *  ");
    System.out.println(" *** ");
    System.out.println(" *** ");
    System.out.println("  *  ");
    System.out.println("  *  ");   
will print a tree like this:

  *  
 *** 
 *** 
  *  
  *  
Try it out!

7.Have fun and experiment with different trees.

Here are a couple we made:

 * ** * 
 ****** 
  ****  
   **   
   **   
~~~~~~~~~~
 ***** 
 ***** 
 ***** 
   *   
   *   
#######
You can explore other printing methods in the Java documentation.

//Code:
// Define your tree class in this file!
class Tree{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    // we are going to plant a tree to the screen
    System.out.println ("Hey AnOnYmOus001100 here.");
    System.out.println ("plant tree on the screen using java.");
        System.out.println ("  *  ");
    System.out.println (" *** ");
    System.out.println (" *** ");
    System.out.println ("  *  ");
    System.out.println ("  *  ");
    System.out.println("Another tree\n");
    System.out.println ("* ** *");
    System.out.println ("******");
    System.out.println (" **** ");
    System.out.println ("  **  ");
    System.out.println ("  **  ");
    System.out.println ("~~~~~~");
    System.out.println("Another tree\n");
    System.out.println("*****");
    System.out.println ("*****");
    System.out.println ("*****");
    System.out.println ("  *  ");
    System.out.println ("  *  ");
    System.out.println ("######");
  
  }
}
